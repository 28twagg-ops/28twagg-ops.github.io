PIXEL-NET HOMEPAGE ARCHIVE INSTRUCTIONS

You asked to keep the previous homepage structure in the repo so you can return to it later.

Because this patch ZIP can’t see your current index.html contents from here, do this ONE TIME locally:

1) Before you overwrite your homepage, copy your existing file:
   - If your homepage is at:  PIXEL-NET/index.html
     copy it to:
     PIXEL-NET/_archive/homepage_previous/index__before_new_homepage.html

2) Then apply the patch (this ZIP) which overwrites PIXEL-NET/index.html with the new design.

That’s all — you’ll always have the prior homepage preserved in that archive folder.
