# Changelog

## [2026‑02‑01] – New games added

### Neon Trail Riders

* Introduced **Neon Trail Riders**, an original light‑cycle survival game.
* Navigate a glowing grid while leaving behind a persistent trail.  Crashing into your trail or the arena walls ends your run.
* Collect pulsing orbs to earn a 50‑point bonus and clear part of your trail, adding a strategic risk/reward mechanic.
* Speed ramps up over time for escalating difficulty.
* Score is automatically submitted to the PIXEL‑NET leaderboard on game over.  Press **Enter** to restart after a crash.

Further updates will continue to expand the PIXEL‑NET arcade with more original titles.

### Neon Arena Assault

* Added **Neon Arena Assault**, a twin‑stick style arena shooter.
* Move with **WASD** and fire with the **arrow keys**; combine keys for diagonal shots.
* Enemies spawn from all four edges and home in on the player.  Spawn rate and speed increase over time.
* Includes a combo system: kill enemies in quick succession to increase the multiplier up to ×10.  Each kill awards `10 × combo` points; the combo resets if you wait too long.
* Particle explosions and neon gradients deliver satisfying feedback for each victory.
* Score submits automatically at game over, and you can restart with **Enter**.
